# SRS-Software-Requirements-Specification-
SRS documentation for FarmBot software (An Open-Source CNC Farming Product) 

This is our SRS (Software Requirements Specification) documentation project for our Software Engineering Class with my friend Erencan Ceyhan. It is based on the ISO/IEC/IEEE Standard 29148-2018


SRS focuses on the Farmbot software:

This project gave us a chance to improve our skills on Requirement Engineering and also get familiar with the UML diagrams and representations in software engineering
